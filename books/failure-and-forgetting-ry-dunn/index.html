  <h2>Failure & Forgetting <span>by Ry Dunn</span></h2>
  <p class="ital">Emphatic, emotional, from a tender heart inside of tender meat. If failures and forgettings leave holes in our lives, Dunn teaches us how to fill them back up with our spoils – the shit, the tears, the broken glass and broken teeth. Failure & Forgetting is a cleansing ritual; it gets us back on the bus for the nervy ride home.</p>

  <p class="title">this is not form</p>
  
  <p class="line">this is the anthem</p>
  <p class="line">this is the crying</p>
  <p class="line">alone in my room</p>
  <p class="line">This is the third</p>
  <p class="line">time this week</p>
  <p class="line">this is the rot</p>
  <p class="line">the core the apple</p>
  <p class="line">like I always knew</p>
  <p class="line">you were a Rose</p>
  <p class="line">deep down</p>
  <p class="line">this is the holes</p>
  <p class="line">In my slacks</p>
  <p class="line">the holes in my ass</p>
  <p class="line">this is the times</p>
  <p class="line">we live and die in</p>
  <p class="line">this is the anthem to</p>
  <p class="line">a memory lost to</p>
  <p class="line">plague this lingering</p>
  <p class="line">panic like the blood</p>
  <p class="line">drip from the prick</p>
  <p class="line">of a rose thorn</p>
  <p class="line">this is a moment</p>
  <p class="line">between my sad</p>
  <p class="line">farts and the band</p>
  <p class="line">that played</p>
  <p class="line">this is the last time</p>
  <p class="line">we fucked on a bed</p>
  <p class="line">in a hotel on</p>
  <p class="line">folsom street</p>
  <p class="line">that was the last time</p>
  <p class="line">my farts smelled</p>
  <p class="line">like cum for</p>
  <p class="line">three days</p>
  <p class="line">this is the bomb</p>
  <p class="line">in the precinct</p>
  <p class="line">this is the patricide</p>
  <p class="line">the final suicide</p>
  <p class="line">the mark my words</p>
  <p class="line">my breath stank</p>
  <p class="line">and the smoke rises</p>
  <p class="line">from the north west</p>
  <p class="line">corner of this</p>
  <p class="line">is the Whiteaker</p>
  <p class="line">in the late 90s</p>
  <p class="line">this is the beguiled</p>
  <p class="line">new student to</p>
  <p class="line">the old designs</p>
  <p class="line">of thrash against</p>
  <p class="line">an ancient wall</p>
  <p class="line">this is the end</p>
  <p class="line">of an old trail anew</p>
  <p class="line">thought rendered</p>
  <p class="line">inescapable by drugs</p>
  <p class="line">because this is not</p>
  <p class="line">the form I meant to</p>
  <p class="line">carry, this is the cock</p>
  <p class="line">I did not mean to sit</p>
  <p class="line">atop, this is not</p>
  <p class="line">a maybe next time</p>
  <p class="line">this is the end of</p>
  <p class="line">a poem</p>

  <p>From <a href="https://www.glitsinc.org/donations">G.L.I.T.S</a>: &ldquo;We approach the health and rights crises faced by transgender sex workers holistically using harm reduction, human rights principles, economic and social justice, along with a commitment to empowerment and pride in finding solutions from our own community. The first issue we address is that of immediate need/crisis support for transgender sex workers, including community members from the NYC area, across the US and globally through supporting asylum seekers from our priority communities. The next issue we address is health care and health resilience for transgender sex workers. We need to address this issue because our community is hypermarginalized and has a profound need for safe sex supplies and free/low cost health to address both trans specific and holistic needs. We currently work on housing since so many in our G.L.I.T.S.’ community are without stable housing, deepening the cycle of disenfranchisement. G.L.I.T.S. also advocates and educates to ensure health, wellness and inclusion of transgender people in our society and to address the stigmatization and criminalization of trans people because of anti-prostitution/anti-sex work laws.&rdquo;</p>
