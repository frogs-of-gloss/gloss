  <h2>October Poems <span>by Laura Henriksen</span></h2>
  <p class="ital">A rough bit of fun with 13 figures of fear. Girls haunted by love, parking lots haunted by girls. The air has a verve when the dead rise again, sticky & smelling of oil. Henriksen offers up the final shake of a judge&rsquo;s wig, showering us with the bugs that live inside.</p>

  <p class="title">Black Dog</p>
  
  <p class="line">The law is a white dog and death</p>
  <p class="line">is a black dog. My love is a white</p>
  <p class="line">stone and my word is at the back</p>
  <p class="line">of the freezer. Dinner is at seven</p>
  <p class="line">but we&rsquo;ll never make it. Pursued</p>
  <p class="line">while also in hot pursuit, I never</p>
  <p class="line">caught my breath again so focused</p>
  <p class="line">was I, unbecoming. The night</p>
  <p class="line">is a lost frog, the dream is a night</p>
  <p class="line">lawn. No god got it more wrong.</p>
  <p class="line">You walk in and everyone in the bar</p>
  <p class="line">shares a secret but you don&rsquo;t know</p>
  <p class="line">that, my outsider riding time&rsquo;s</p>
  <p class="line">melancholy orange peel, applauding.</p>
  <p class="line">When the bell rang all the birds flew</p>
  <p class="line">away and when it stopped they</p>
  <p class="line">returned. My head is a graveyard</p>
  <p class="line">and my home is this meadow. Below</p>
  <p class="line">the floorboards, teeth glistening,</p>
  <p class="line">patient, I know we die a little</p>
  <p class="line">each day, but that&rsquo;s not enough,</p>
  <p class="line">baby, soft black dog, cold country.</p>
  <p class="line">I&rsquo;ll see you in my dreams and</p>
  <p class="line">in the morning I won&rsquo;t remember.</p>
  <p class="line">Just pour my coffee and add my</p>
  <p class="line">sugar, feel the cup hot in my hands.</p>
